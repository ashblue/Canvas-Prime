Development Version
=============

The development version of Canvas Prime is a a large number of separate files that make up the engine itself. You can compile all of these objects into a single file by running a PHP script (coming soon).

There are several advantages to this method:

* Extremely easy to find and maintain section of the engine
* Alter the core for any project without a headache
* Users can submit patches or new features with ease
* Who wants to work in a massive unobtainable file?
